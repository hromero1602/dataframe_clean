If the choice is between mining for bitcoin - which wastes hydroelectric power and takes up empty office space -- or mining for gold &amp
"<br/>To me, Bitcoin (et al) appears to be an expensive game a number of speculative people, many who want to hide their money, are playing. <br/><br/>The problem: it is only etherial math. Neat, but not worth anything if people get turned off the game by losing money. A matter of time, I believe, because it's too much like a Ponzi scheme."
"Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme backed by nothing and meaning nothing.  It is useful to criminal enterprises, terrorists and those bent on evading taxes. It is not a generally accepted form of currency and it will never be.  Yes, we are wasting huge amounts of economic potential on financial engineering instead of building infrastructure, devising new architectural methods, and rising to the challenges of global warming, rising seas, harsh storms and lack of potable water.  When the historians look back on us a thousand years hence (if there are historians a thousand years hence), they will see how foolish our moment in time was.  And, they will laugh and cry over our stupidity. "
"What does it cost in energy to dig up and refine an ounce of gold?  Are bitcoins any worse?  It's important to realize that they're not ""virtual dollars"", but rather ""virtual gold"", and subject to the same sort of lunacy as all precious metals.<br/>Thus, the main problem with a bitcoin is that its ""value"" tomorrow, let alone next week, is unknowable, while it's price is much more easily manipulated than is the price of gold or the value of a dollar.<br/>Cryptocurrencies have only two utilties: (1) you can buy goods or services on the other side of the world without having to pay extortionate fees to financial institutions, and (2) tax and law enforcement authorities can't detect or trace the transaction.   I'm pretty sure #2 is the biggie right now, although I'd be happy to take advantage of #1 if the medium could hold a consistent value from contract through purchase."
